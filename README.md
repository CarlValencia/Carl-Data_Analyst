1. Preparation  
	- Basic Data Cleaning/ Validation (Excel)  
		> I checked every CSV file and corrected the formats and data types. I also checked for duplicates and anomalies in the data. This is also in preparation of inserting it into a database (PostgreSQL) to lessen errors and ensure consistent, reliable data before loading it in for further querying and analysis.  

	- Data Prep/ Loading (DBeaver & PostgreSQL)  
		> Used DBeaver for mapping data types and batch insertion of tables.  


2. Descriptive Analysis  
3. Diagnostic Analysis  
4. Insights/ Recommendations
